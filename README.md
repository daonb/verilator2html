verilator2html
==============
This is my hack solution for converting Verilator logs into browseable HTML reports. It allows you to browse all your errors and warnings, and sort/filter them any way you like.  
The core Javascript code used is taken from https://github.com/chestercharles/excel-bootstrap-table-filter
As my knowledge on frontend web development is nonexistent and mostly based on copy/paste and stackoverflow, feel free to improve.

The dist/ files in my repo are taken from the following version:
